# Publish the initium CLI on NPM

This folder is here to generate an npm package that will allow user to run initium with either npm or npx.

NOTE: This package doesn't contain the binaries.

You can check the code in the `script` folder to see how this package will detect the platform and architecture of your machine and download the relevant binary from the github releases of this repo.
